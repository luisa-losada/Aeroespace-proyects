#  Weather Observation Satellite Simulator

This is an educational simulation of a weather satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.

##  Objective

To model the behavior and interactions of various satellite subsystems, simulating normal operations and unexpected anomalies.

##  Included Subsystems

- **PowerSystem**: Manages solar energy input and battery charge
- **AttitudeControlSystem**: Controls satellite orientation and monitors altitude
- **PayloadCamera**: Simulates thermal camera with operational limits
- **CommSystem**: Handles data transmission to Earth
- **ThermalControlSystem**: Regulates internal temperatures
- **NavigationSystem**: Detects and corrects orbital drift
- **EventManager**: Randomly introduces space anomalies (eclipses, failures, etc.)
##  OOP Principles Used

- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction** (via an abstract base class for subsystems)
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

It will simulate 5 satellite operation cycles.
